## Welcome 👋
We are Hektor + Rydzewski Bild + Ton Produktion LLC, a german media company.

### Full-Service
Welcome to Hektor + Rydzewski. Our maxim is: “Full service”. That's why we take care of all your needs in the field of electronic media.
The spectrum of our services not only includes all organizational and technical work, we also put our creativity at your disposal. 

### Everything under one roof
The close proximity of our offices, editing suites, sound studios, multimedia workstations and studios in our production house in Düsseldorf-Bilk enables the work steps to be literally “interlinked”.
This is also where our team vans set off every day to shoot and live stream for our customers.

### No friction losses
This approach ensures a production process in which “one hand fits into the other”.
The “friction losses” that naturally occur in more complex productions are kept to a minimum.
Ultimately, this leads to better results and enables cost-effective production.
